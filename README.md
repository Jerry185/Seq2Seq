## Seq2Seq Keras

A general purpose library for training seq2seq models on a parallel corpus. No explicit programming is required, training script will take care of preprocessing the data, compiling the model and then training on the corpus. It's a general purpose library, so it can be used for different NLP tasks which requires seq2seq mapping like Text Summarization, Question Answering system, Chatbots etc. 

## Requirements

* keras

* numpy

* theano/tensorflow

* CUDA and CuDNN (if using GPU)

# TO-DO

* Current parameters hard coded, add argument parser

* Add model saving method

* Add model loading method
